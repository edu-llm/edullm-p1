"""Scan one corpus domain for eval-item n-grams (methodology v4, sections 3, 5, 6).

One task per domain. Emits every (item, field, document) match plus a DONE
sentinel, and refuses to emit anything if its own positive controls are not
recovered.

Why a rolling hash. The corpus is on the order of billions of word positions.
Building an 8-word string at every position to probe the prefilter costs on
the order of CPU-hours in Python. Instead a rolling polynomial hash over
per-word hashes is carried across the window, which is a handful of integer
ops per position, and the 8-word string is only materialized when the integer
prefilter hits. Word hashes come from blake2b rather than `hash()`, so nothing
here depends on PYTHONHASHSEED and the index is comparable across processes by
construction.

Collisions are not a correctness risk: the modulus is 2**61-1 and there are
~1.3e6 prefixes, so across billions of positions the expected number of
spurious prefilter hits is negligible -- and every prefilter hit is confirmed
by exact string comparison before it is recorded, so a collision costs time,
never a false positive.

Silent-failure gates, per v4 section 6:

  - Canary. A fixed RAW document whose expected post-normalization key set is
    asserted. This catches a normalizer divergence between index build and
    scan, which a canary made of a pre-normalized string cannot: that failure
    yields zero hits and a passing canary.
  - Spikes. Synthetic documents carrying known item n-grams, built from raw
    un-normalized text with varied casing and punctuation so the normalizer is
    on trial rather than tested against itself. Injected in the piece format
    through the real reader. Nothing is emitted until all are recovered, and
    they are removed by row identity, never by subtracting counts -- count
    subtraction cancels the first real hit in any cell holding a spike, which
    floors every rate at zero while reporting success.
  - DONE sentinel carrying docs_scanned and words_scanned, so the aggregator
    can assert full coverage after the scan rather than trusting a glob.

Vendored from the private training monorepo's `.edullm/contamination/scan_corpus.py`
at commit `52fe3fac10329c0319fb39b18cfb59e462ed84b9`. The only change from that
copy is the import of `item_identity`, which is now a sibling file in this
directory instead of a `sys.path`-relative package -- no behavior differs.

    """Iterate decoded lines from a .gz, .zst/.zstd, or plain JSONL file.

    Not every corpus uses one compressor. In the olmo-mix pool that seeded the
    domain-weighting experiment, one domain shipped as `.jsonl.zstd` while all
    others were `.json.gz` -- and a gzip-only reader fails on it instantly.

    zstd is streamed through the CLI because no Python zstd module is
    guaranteed to be installed on the scanning host (no `zstandard`, `pyzstd`,
    or stdlib `compression.zstd`) while `/usr/bin/zstd` typically is.

    The exit status is enforced only when the stream was read to EOF. That
    distinction matters in both directions: a decompressor that dies partway
    just ends the pipe, so the caller's loop finishes normally and an
    unchecked failure would silently truncate the scan and report a clean
    result over a fraction of the corpus -- but a caller that stops early on
    purpose (--limit-docs) closes the pipe and earns a SIGPIPE, which is not
    an error. A generator gets this right for free: natural exhaustion sets
    the flag, an early `break` closes the generator instead.
