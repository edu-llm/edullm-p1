"""Canonical eval-item identity: normalization, preamble stripping, hashing.

Shared deliberately. The contamination scan searches the corpus for strings
derived from eval items, and the training-time evaluator records a hash of the
items it scored. Those two must agree exactly or the join between a
contamination hit and a per-item bpb number is silently wrong -- and a join
that is off by one produces entirely plausible numbers, which is the failure
mode this campaign keeps hitting. Two copies of "the same" normalizer is the
obvious way to get there, so there is one copy and both callers import it.

Stdlib only, so it is testable without torch, olmo_core or ai2-olmo -- none of
which can be imported on a laptop or a CPU node.

Vendored unchanged from the private training monorepo's
`.edullm/task_loss/item_identity.py` at commit `52fe3fac10329c0319fb39b18cfb59e462ed84b9`.

being imported from that repo.

    `strip_preamble` only finds a prefix shared by EVERY item in a label. That
    is right for most labels, but wrong for MMLU: its five exemplars are drawn
    per subject, so items share a block with their own subject and not across
    subjects. The label-wide prefix is then a few words, nothing is stripped,
    and ~95% of an MMLU "stem" is exemplar text -- which would be indexed as
    if it were the item, so one mirrored copy of a subject's dev examples
    would match every item in that subject.

    Sorting puts items that share a prefix next to each other, so an exemplar
    block shows up as a run of consecutive items sharing a long prefix. This
    is format-agnostic: it needs no knowledge of how a prompt separates
    exemplars from the question, which differs by benchmark, and it handles
    the label-wide case as well as the per-subject one.

    Two guards keep it from over-trimming. The prefix must be shared by a run
    of MIN_SHARERS+1 items, so two questions that happen to open with the same
    few words are left alone -- shortening those would only cost recall, and
    could push an item under the assessability floor. And it must be at least
